In Black Office we will be using CircleCi to co-ordinate and Integrate all of your work into the Software that gets shipped to Clients/User through www.ese-edet.eu
You will be implementing what we in the Company call "fragments", read the DSS Documentation in each of your fragments, follow it, implement the interfaces,
throughly implement and test them, using a rich variety of possible user input to make sure your fragment doesn't break under pressure in the most vividly wild, unforeseen and unimaginable Scenarios, use Unit Testing,
when you are completely happy, Commit using Circle Ci.

At ESE we will see the Commit ourselves, test your work, make sure it integrates seamlessly with the main branch and works as specified and required in the Documentation, once we
are happy, we will ask you to raise your Invoice at People per hour for your funds to be released to you immediately, then repeat this process for the next fragment
and then for next one after that and then for the next one after that...

all the best and happy Implementation.
