To maintain your gains carry on using the App, making sure your Balance stays at Zero, note that if your Balance goes minus to below zero, it means you can and should eat more Calories, for you are not counting down but maintaining. Or you could set and start a new Weight loss target by using the Start Weight Loss Option again.</string>
