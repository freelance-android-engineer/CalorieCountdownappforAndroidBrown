 * CiF18 is delimeted by activate countdown start date and target data (plus some extra for overflow) and the end of each day (Midnight)
 * days current number is stored in CiF18 to be stored in RMS. Decide the format of RMS data and code to actually do this and store.

 Calendar set a new thread like Reminder menutiem.
 Deals with end of day events 6pm (Step 10 Listener, listen for this day end signal) where 2500/2000 is added up.
 (Step 11 Method callSignal to allow call right method(already implemented)) At same time day end coutdonw number stored in record stare per day for
 //progress & analysis & estimate time to weight loss
 //(include in previous Methods) Methods: track progress, predict. Store in record store or hastable, meaure, input

 (finish for now, implement skeleton functions, back to CiF Revision to load -> www.ese-edet.eu)
 //CountdownCalendar tracks the progress of the Client to Zero(Client -> www.ese-edet.eu) it is intialised after Activate Countdown
 //(Health Profile also stored here)
 //menuitem is completed, it is activated with the calculated start countdown figure.
 //it records and tracks progress of the countdown for each day and at the right time each day it produces the day's start per day, (i.e. per calendar entry)
 //countdown - 2500/2000.
 //When given CCDGUICiF in plots a graph of countdown progress so far called rate of countdown, plus distance to target date/showing progress needed
 //to target date which has to be another menuitem for the Client. (Must be Blackboard Posted)
 dates and work done in thoses dates stoted in database.

 *
 * Design needed functions, At the Start /End of MIDlet application (in startApp and endApp) all function to store calorie number in CiF18
 * CiF18 is delimeted by activate countdown start date and target data (plus some extra for overflow) and the end of each day (Midnight)
 * days current number is stored in CiF18 to be stored in RMS. Decide the format of RMS data and code to actually do this and store.
 * As usaul pack and organise all this in function format

 *
 * TESTING AND PERFORMANCE LOGS
 *
 * Generate as many test case as you can, one extra point for every correct
 * test case.
 *
 * In each test case use different examples of inputs to show that the Method's Output
 * is right everytime.
 *
 * Use a wide range and varying inputs to cover as many different scenarios as possible.
 * Aim to write efficient code so that your implementation runs as fast and correctly as possible.
 *
 * Submit your implementation work back to ese_blackboard@ese-edet.com and wait for you
 * CIF Implementation to be acknowledged, approved and your Points added to you account.
